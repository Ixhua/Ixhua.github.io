### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was my favorite lab because we learned how to code for card games. I love card games it was fun to work with
* Lab 1 and 2
    Lab 1 and 2 was one of my favorite labs because I had a great partner who knew how to guide me through the code and I was able to contribute proper logic for the code.
